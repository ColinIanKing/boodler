# If you are configuring on a platform where floating-point math is
# very expensive, or not available, you may have to uncomment the two
# lines below. The intmath option builds Boodler to use all integer
# math.

# If you are configuring Boodler on a desktop PC, leave this option
# alone. Boodler uses floating-point math by default, and that's what
# you want.
