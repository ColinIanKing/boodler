<h2>Boodler: Version History</h2>

<ul>

<li>1.5.3 (May 2, 2002)
<p>
Improved skip-resistance in MacOSX version, by using a multiple sound
buffers. Added <code>--define buffercount=<em>count</em></code> option,
to control this.
<p>

<li>1.5.2 (Apr 30, 2002)
<p>
Added MacOSX support. Tested with Python installed as an OSX framework;
might also work with "Unix-style" Python configuration.
<p>

<li>1.5.0 (Feb 19, 2002)
<p>
Added the <code>stereo</code> module, and the ability to create a channel
at a particular stereo position. (No, you still can't <em>change</em> a
channel's stereo position as it plays. That's harder. Sorry.)
<p>
Added many sounds to the library, and many soundscapes to the effects
directory.
<p>

<li>1.4.0 (Dec 17, 2001)
<p>
Added the pwrain and owstorm modules, contributed by Peter and Owen Williams.
<p>
Added support for Unix domain sockets, as an alternative to network
sockets.
<p>

<li>1.3.0 (Dec 12, 2001)
<p>
Added the <code>--integer</code> argument to <code>configure.py</code>.
This uses integer computation in some places instead of floating-point
computation. Possibly useful on very old machines, or very tiny ones
(such as PDAs).
<p>
Removed some obsolete code from the OSS driver, which was failing on
the Zaurus.
<p>

<li>1.2.0 (Dec 3, 2001)
<p>
Added a command-line argument which is passed down to the sound interface
unchanged. This allows interface-specific arguments.
<p>
Added the FILE interface, which writes raw sound output to a disk file
instead of to the computer's sound hardware.
<p>
Added some agents to the listen module, which respond to standard 
remote-control button events. (See the serialwatch.py script on the
"Accessories" page of the
<a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/boodler/">Boodler project 
web site</a>.)
<p>

<li>1.1.0 (Nov 27, 2001)
<p>
Added configuration script.
Added support for ALSA and ESD sound interfaces.
<p>
Fixed bug in OSS interface which caused clicking on machines with only
two kernel sound buffers.
<p>
Rearranged the event-listening system. Agents must now be of a particular
subclass (EventAgent) in order to be posted to listen for events. The
event triggers an agent.receive(event) method, instead of agent.run().
<p>

<li>Initial release (Nov 22, 2001)
<p>
Initial release. Only supports OSS sound driver.

</ul>
